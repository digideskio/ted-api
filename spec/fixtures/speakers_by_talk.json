In fact, <strong>his campaign for alerting the world to the dangers of climate change<\/strong> has only gained momentum. His Oscar-winning <a href=\"http:\/\/www.climatecrisis.net\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>An Inconvenient Truth<\/em><\/a> is the third most successful documentary ever released at the box office. Gore&#39;s famed PowerPoint presentation has drawn in a reluctant public, with its meticulously researched content and lucid style. <\/p><p>Meanwhile, Gore himself has found his footing as a communicator. The once &quot;wooden&quot; style has given way to <strong>a warmth and humor that reveal the depth of his experience<\/strong> as a soldier, congressman, senator, veep, TV executive, teacher and author. Arguably, Gore is better positioned today than he has ever been to affect the future of our environment and world. <\/p><p>He was awarded the <a href=\"http:\/\/nobelprize.org\/nobel_prizes\/peace\/laureates\/2007\/\">Nobel Peace Prize for 2007<\/a>, along with the <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)<\/a><\/strong>, &quot;for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for <strong>the measures that are needed to counteract such change<\/strong>.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"al_gore","published_at":"2007-02-13 10:43:00","updated_at":"2009-04-08 14:44:57"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
