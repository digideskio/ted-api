      <description>Climate-change prophet</description>
      <whotheyare>Once the US Vice President, then star of &lt;em&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/em&gt;, now Nobel Peace Prize winner, Al Gore found a way to focus the world's attention on climate change. In doing so, he has invented a new medium -- the Keynote movie -- and reinvented himself.</whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;Unlike some in public office, Al Gore always intended to get something done, and since leaving Washington, DC -- following the tumultuous 2000 election -- he&amp;#39;s still at it. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;his campaign for alerting the world to the dangers of climate change&lt;/strong&gt; has only gained momentum. His Oscar-winning &lt;a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the third most successful documentary ever released at the box office. Gore&amp;#39;s famed PowerPoint presentation has drawn in a reluctant public, with its meticulously researched content and lucid style. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Gore himself has found his footing as a communicator. The once &amp;quot;wooden&amp;quot; style has given way to &lt;strong&gt;a warmth and humor that reveal the depth of his experience&lt;/strong&gt; as a soldier, congressman, senator, veep, TV executive, teacher and author. Arguably, Gore is better positioned today than he has ever been to affect the future of our environment and world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was awarded the &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize for 2007&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &amp;quot;for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for &lt;strong&gt;the measures that are needed to counteract such change&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

      <whotheyare>Amy Smith designs cheap, practical fixes for tough problems in developing countries. Among her many accomplishments, the MIT engineer received a MacArthur "genius" grant in 2004 and was the first woman to win the Lemelson-MIT Prize for turning her ideas into inventions.</whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;Mechanical engineer Amy Smith&amp;#39;s approach to problem-solving in developing nations is refreshingly common-sense: &lt;strong&gt;Invent cheap, low-tech devices that use local resources, so communities can reproduce her efforts and ultimately help themselves.&lt;/strong&gt; Smith, working with her students at MIT&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;D-Lab, has come up with several useful tools, including an incubator that stays warm without electricity, a simple grain mill, and a tool that converts farm waste into cleaner-burning charcoal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inventions have earned Smith three prestigious prizes: the B.F. Goodrich Collegiate Inventors Award, the MIT-Lemelson Prize, and a MacArthur &amp;quot;genius&amp;quot; grant. Her course, &amp;quot;Design for Developing Countries,&amp;quot; is a pioneer in &lt;strong&gt;bringing humanitarian design into the curriculum of major institutions&lt;/strong&gt;. Going forward, the former &lt;a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;Peace Corps&lt;/a&gt;  volunteer strives to do much more, bringing her inventiveness and boundless energy to bear on some of the world&amp;#39;s most persistent problems.&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

      <description>Expert on state-building</description>
      <whotheyare>Ashraf Ghani was a key figure in rebuilding Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban, and is a leading advocate for foreign investment (rather than foreign aid) as a tool for economic development and the eradication of poverty. </whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Before Afghanistan&amp;#39;s President Karzai asked him, at the end of 2001, to become his advisor and then Finance Minister, Ashraf Ghani had spent years in academia studying state-building and social transformation, and a decade in executive positions at the&amp;nbsp;World Bank&amp;nbsp;trying to effect policy in these two fields. &lt;strong&gt;In just 30 months, he carried out radical and effective reforms (a new currency, new budget, new tariffs, etc)&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and was instrumental in preparing for the elections of October 2004. In 2006, he was a candidate to succeed Kofi Annan as Secretary General of the United Nations, and one year later, was put in the running to head the World Bank. He served as Chancellor of&amp;nbsp;Kabul University, where he ran a program on state effectiveness. His message to the world: &amp;quot;Afghanistan should not be approached as a charity, but as an investment.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Clare Lockhart, he runs the&amp;nbsp;Institute for State Effectiveness, which examines the relationships among citizens, the state and the market. The ISE advises countries, companies, and NGOs; once focused mainly on Afghanistan, its mission has expanded to cover the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Ghani ran against Hamid Karzai in the 2009 Afghani presidential elections, emphasizing the importance of government transparency and accountability, strong infrastructure and economic investment, and a merit-based political system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-right: 17pt; line-height: 16pt" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="ArialMT, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="Apple-style-span" color="#545454"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

      <description>Aircraft engineer</description>
      <whotheyare>In 2004, legendary spacecraft designer Burt Rutan won the $10M Ansari X-Prize for &lt;em&gt;SpaceShipOne,&lt;/em&gt; the first privately funded craft to enter space twice in a two-week period. He's now collaborating with Virgin Galactic to build the first rocketship for space tourism.</whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;Burt Rutan is widely regarded as one of the world&amp;#39;s most important industrial designers, and his prolific contributions to air- and spacecraft design have driven the industry forward for decades. His two companies, &lt;a href="http://www.rutanaircraft.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Rutan Aircraft Factory&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://www.scaled.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Scaled Composites&lt;/a&gt;, have developed and flight-tested more new types of aircraft than the rest of the US industry combined. He has himself designed hundreds of aircraft, including the famous &lt;em&gt;Voyager,&lt;/em&gt; which his brother piloted on a record-breaking nine-day nonstop flight around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rutan might also be the person to make low-cost space tourism a reality: &lt;strong&gt;He&amp;#39;s one of the major players promoting entrepreneurial approaches to space exploration&lt;/strong&gt;, and his collaboration with &lt;a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Virgin Galactic&lt;/a&gt;  is the most promising of these efforts. SpaceShipTwo, a collaboration between Richard Branson and Rutan completed its first &amp;quot;captive carry&amp;quot; in March of 2010, marking the beginning of the era of commercial space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever the maverick, Rutan is known for both his bold proclamations and his criticism of the aerospace industry. Witness the opening line of his presentation at TED2006: &amp;quot;Houston, we have a problem. We&amp;#39;re entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

      <whotheyare>Car design is a ubiquitous but often overlooked art form. As chief of design for the BMW Group, Chris Bangle has overseen cars that have been seen the world over, including BMW 7 Series and the Z4 roadster.</whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;American designer Chris Bangle understands that &lt;strong&gt;it can be difficult to see a car in terms of Art with a capital A&lt;/strong&gt;. As such, he separates his work into issues of &amp;quot;automobiles&amp;quot; (unemotional products, causing problems such as pollution and congestion) and &amp;quot;car-iness&amp;quot; (an expansion of the human, and ultimately a truly artistic expression). Satisfying the tensions between these problems -- and the tensions between engineers and designers -- is, for him, the essence of his work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering &lt;strong&gt;radical forms and ideas&lt;/strong&gt;, Bangle has been a polarizing figure within the industry; he has overseen all of the brands within the &lt;a href="http://www.bmw.com/" target="_blank"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;  family, including &lt;a href="http://www.mini.com/mini_worldwide/mini_worldwide.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mini&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Rolls-Royce&lt;/a&gt;. In 2009, Bangle left BMW to pursue his own personal design interests and develop his consulting firm, Chris Bangle Associates.&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

      <description>Biologist, genetics pioneer</description>
      <whotheyare>In 2001, Craig Venter made headlines for sequencing the human genome. In 2003, he started mapping the ocean's biodiversity. And now he's created the first synthetic lifeforms -- microorganisms that can produce alternative fuels.</whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;Craig Venter, the man who led the private effort to sequence the human genome, is hard at work now on even more potentially world-changing projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, there&amp;#39;s his mission aboard the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sorcerer2expedition.org/version1/HTML/main.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Sorcerer II&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; a 92-foot yacht&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;which, in 2006, finished its voyage around the globe to sample, catalouge and decode the genes of the ocean&amp;#39;s unknown microorganisms. Quite a task, when you consider that there are tens of millions of microbes in a single drop of sea water. Then there&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href="http://www.jcvi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;J. Craig Venter Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit dedicated to researching genomics and exploring its societal implications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Venter founded &lt;a href="http://www.syntheticgenomics.com/about.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Synthetic Genomics&lt;/a&gt;, a private company with &lt;strong&gt;a provocative mission: to engineer new life forms&lt;/strong&gt;. Its goal is to design, synthesize and assemble &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_laboratorium" target="_blank"&gt;synthetic microorganisms&lt;/a&gt;  that will produce alternative fuels, such as ethanol or hydrogen. He was on &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  magzine&amp;#39;s 2007 list of the &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100" target="_blank"&gt;100 Most Influential People in the World.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2008, scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute announced that they had manufactured the entire genome of a bacterium by painstakingly stitching together its chemical components. By sequencing a genome, scientists can begin to custom-design bootable organisms, creating biological robots that can produce from scratch chemicals humans can use, such as biofuel. And in 2010, they announced, they had created &amp;quot;synthetic life&amp;quot; -- DNA created digitally, inserted into a living bacterium, and remaining alive.&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

      <whotheyare>Architect David Rockwell draws on his love of drama and spectacle to create fantastic, high-impact restaurants, malls, airline terminals, theater sets -- and playgrounds. </whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Rockwell  does dramatic design&lt;/strong&gt;, from the sleek interiors of Nobu and the W Hotels to the exuberant Mohegan Sun Casino, from the pop-tastic scenery for the Broadway musical &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; to the sublimely hilarious high-modern sets for &lt;em&gt;Team America: World Police&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He won the Presidential Design Award for &lt;strong&gt;his extraordinary work renovating New York&amp;#39;s Grand Central Station&lt;/strong&gt;, and his firm, the &lt;a href="http://www.rockwellgroup.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Rockwell Group&lt;/a&gt;, is designing the interior for the JetBlue terminal at New York&amp;#39;s JFK Airport. Rockwell has published several books on his architectural and design process, including &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pleasure-Architecture-Design-Rockwell-Group/dp/0789308029/ref=sr_1_7/002-9598594-4856004?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1180364723&amp;amp;sr=1-7" target="_blank"&gt;Pleasure&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spectacle-David-Rockwell/dp/0714845744/ref=sr_1_1/002-9598594-4856004?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1180364723&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"&gt;Spectacle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt; -- two qualities that abound in his work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rockwell is no mere drama junkie. His designs for a temporary viewing platform at Ground Zero, constructed in the days after 9/11, demonstrate his ability to tune in to the requirements of each space. Meanwhile, a recent project takes the playfulness inherent in his work to its logical conclusion: the Imagination Playground is a free-play space for kids. The first playground is being built at Burling Slip in Manhattan, and plans are afoot to bring the concept nationwide in partnership with KaBOOM! The Burling Slip Imagination Playground is scheduled to open July of 2010.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="/speakers/chee_pearlman.html" target="_blank"&gt;Chee Pearlman&lt;/a&gt;, Rockwell was co-curator of the TED2012 session &amp;quot;The Design Studio.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

Recent projects include portable energy and water purification for the developing world, and a prosthetic arm for maimed soldiers.</whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;Dean Kamen is an innovator, but not just of things. &lt;strong&gt;He hopes to revolutionize attitudes, quality of life, awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; While an undergraduate, he developed the first portable infusion device, which delivers drug treatments that once required round-the-clock hospital care. And, through his &lt;a href="http://www.dekaresearch.com" target="_blank"&gt;DEKA Research and Development&lt;/a&gt;, which he cofounded in 1982, he developed a portable dialysis machine, a vascular stent, and the &lt;a href="http://www.ibotnow.com/" target="_blank"&gt;iBOT&lt;/a&gt;  -- a motorized wheelchair that climbs stairs (Stephen Colbert took one for a spin). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, he&amp;#39;s a college dropout, but he&amp;#39;s a huge believer in education, and in 1989 established the nonprofit &lt;a href="http://www.usfirst.org/" target="_blank"&gt;FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology)&lt;/a&gt;  to inspire teenagers to pursue careers in science. FIRST sponsors lively annual competitions, where students form teams to create the best robot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His focus now is on off-grid electricity and water purification for developing countries; &lt;strong&gt;another recent project, previewed at TED2007, is a &lt;a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/dean-kamen-lends-a-hand-or-two/" target="_blank"&gt;prosthetic arm&lt;/a&gt;  for maimed soldiers (read an update &lt;a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/feb08/5957" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt; He&amp;#39;s also working on a power source for the wonderful &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/08/01/100138830/index.htm?eref=rss_topstories" target="_blank"&gt;Think car&lt;/a&gt;.

The author of &lt;a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061096273/Eat_More_Weigh_Less/index.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eat More, Weigh Less&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  and several other best-selling books, &lt;strong&gt;Ornish is best known for his lifestyle-based approach to fighting heart disease&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His research at the &lt;a href="http://www.pmri.org/?p=0&amp;amp;pj=index" target="_blank"&gt;Preventive Medicine Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;  (the nonprofit he founded) clinically demonstrated that &lt;strong&gt;cardiovascular illnesses -- and, most recently prostate cancer -- can be treated and even reversed through diet and exercise&lt;/strong&gt;. These findings (once thought to be physiologically implausible) have been widely chronicled in the US media, including &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3037964/site/newsweek/" target="_blank"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; for which Ornish writes a column. The fifty-something physician, who&amp;#39;s received many honors and awards, was chosen by &lt;em&gt;LIFE Magazine&lt;/em&gt; as one of the most influential members of his generation.

      <description>Student, cancer researcher</description>
      <whotheyare>Eva Vertes is a microbiology prodigy. Her discovery, at age 17, of a compound that stops fruit-fly brain cells from dying was regarded as a step toward curing Alzheimer's. Now she aims to find better ways to treat -- and avoid -- cancer.</whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;Eva Vertes may not yet have the answers she needs to cure cancer, but she&amp;#39;s asking some important -- and radical  questions: If smoking can cause lung cancer, and drinking can cause liver cancer, is it possible that cancer is a direct result of injury? If so, &lt;strong&gt;could cancer be caused by the body&amp;#39;s own repair system going awry?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She asks this and other breathtaking questions in her conference-closing 2005 talk. &lt;strong&gt;Her approach marks an important shift in scientific thinking&lt;/strong&gt;, looking in brand-new places for cancer&amp;#39;s cause -- and its cure. Her ultimate goal, which even she calls far-fetched, is to fight cancer with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

      <whotheyare>A living legend, Frank Gehry has forged his own language of architecture, creating astonishing buildings all over the world, such as the Guggenheim in Bilbao, the Walt Disney Concert Hall in LA, and Manhattan's new IAC building.</whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;Frank Gehry is one of the world&amp;#39;s most influential architects. His designs for the likes of the &lt;a href="http://www.guggenheim-bilbao.es/ingles/edificio/el_edificio.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;  and the &lt;a href="http://wdch.laphil.com/about/overview.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;Walt Disney Concert Hall&lt;/a&gt;  in LA are &lt;strong&gt;bold statements that have imposed a new aesthetic of architecture on the world&lt;/strong&gt; at large, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/arts/design/23ouro.html?ref=arts" target="_blank"&gt;enlivening streetscapes&lt;/a&gt;  and creating new destinations. Gehry has extended his vision beyond brick-and-mortar too, collaborating with artists such as Claes Oldenberg and Richard Serra, and designing watches, teapots and a line of &lt;a href="http://www.tiffany.com/shopping/category.aspx?cid=130340&amp;amp;mcat=148204&amp;amp;menu=1&amp;amp;hppromo=CUS2&amp;amp;" target="_blank"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt;  for Tiffany &amp;amp; Co. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in his 80s, &lt;strong&gt;Gehry refuses to slow down or compromise his fierce vision&lt;/strong&gt;: He and his team at &lt;a href="http://www.foga.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Gehry Partners&lt;/a&gt;  are working on a $4 billion development of the &lt;a href="http://www.atlanticyards.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Atlantic Yards&lt;/a&gt;  in Brooklyn, and a spectacular &lt;a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/press_releases/release_159.html" target="_blank"&gt;Guggenheim museum in Abu Dhabi&lt;/a&gt;, United Arab Emirates, which interprets local architecture traditions into a language all his own. Incorporating local architectural motifs without simply paying lip service to Middle Eastern culture, the building bears all the hallmarks of a classic Gehry design.&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

      <whotheyare>Half performance artist, half software engineer, Golan Levin manipulates the computer to create improvised soundscapes with dazzling corresponding visuals. He is at the forefront of defining new parameters for art.</whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;Having worked as an academic at MIT and a researcher specializing in computer technology and software engineering, Golan Levin now spends most of his time working as a performance artist. Rest assured his education hasn&amp;#39;t gone to waste, however, as Levin &lt;strong&gt;blends high tech and customized software programs to create his own extraordinary audio and visual compositions&lt;/strong&gt;. The results are inordinately experimental sonic and visual extravaganzas from the furthest left of the field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of his pieces force audience participation, such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flong.com/telesymphony/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dialtones: A Telesymphony&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;a concert from 2001 entirely composed of the choreographed ringtones of his audience&lt;/strong&gt;. Regularly exhibiting pieces in galleries around the world, and also working as an Assistant Professor of Electronic Time-Based Art at Carnegie Mellon University, Levin is unapologetically pushing boundaries to define a brave new world of what is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His latest piece, &lt;a href="http://www.flong.com/projects/snout/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double-Taker (Snout)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is installed at the Pittsburg Museum of Art.&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

      <description>Anthropologist; expert on love</description>
      <whotheyare>Anthropologist Helen Fisher studies gender differences and the evolution of human emotions. She's best known as an expert on romantic love, and her beautifully penned books -- including &lt;em&gt;Anatomy of Love&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Why We Love&lt;/em&gt; -- lay bare the mysteries of our most treasured emotion.</whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;Helen Fisher&amp;#39;s courageous investigations of romantic love -- its evolution, its biochemical foundations and its vital importance to human society -- are informing and transforming the way we understand ourselves. &lt;strong&gt;Fisher describes love as a universal human drive (stronger than the sex drive; stronger than thirst or hunger; stronger perhaps than the will to live)&lt;/strong&gt;, and her many areas of inquiry shed light on timeless human mysteries, like why we choose one partner over another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost unique among scientists, &lt;strong&gt;Fisher explores the science of love without losing a sense of romance&lt;/strong&gt;: Her work frequently invokes poetry, literature and art -- along with scientific findings -- helping us appreciate our love affair with love itself. In her research, and in books such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780449908976" target="_blank"&gt;Anatomy of Love&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.holtzbrinckpublishers.com/henryholt/search/SearchBookDisplay.asp?BookKey=1291747" target="_blank"&gt;Why We Love&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and her latest work&lt;em style="text-decoration: underline"&gt; &lt;em style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Why Him? Why Her?: How to Find and Keep Lasting Love&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Fisher looks at questions with real impact on modern life. Her latest research raises serious concerns about the widespread, long-term use of antidepressants, which may undermine our natural process of attachment by tampering with hormone levels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

      <whotheyare>A self-proclaimed nature nerd, Janine Benyus' concept of biomimicry has galvanized scientists, architects, designers and engineers into exploring new ways in which nature's successes can inspire humanity. </whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;In the world envisioned by science author Janine Benyus, a locust&amp;#39;s ability to avoid collision within a roiling cloud of its brethren informs the design of a crash-resistant car; &lt;strong&gt;a self-cleaning leaf inspires a new kind of paint, one that dries in a pattern that enables simple rainwater to wash away dirt&lt;/strong&gt;; and organisms capable of living without water open the way for vaccines that maintain potency even without refrigeration -- a hurdle that can prevent life-saving drugs from reaching disease-torn communities. Most important, these cool tools from nature pull off their tricks while still managing to &lt;strong&gt;preserve the environment that sustains them&lt;/strong&gt;, a life-or-death lesson that humankind is in need of learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;strong&gt;a &lt;a href="http://www.biomimicryinstitute.org/" target="_blank"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;  of &lt;a href="http://www.biomimicry.net/" target="_blank"&gt;biomimicry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Benyus has become one of the most important voices in a new wave of designers and engineers inspired by nature. &lt;strong&gt;Her most recent project, &lt;a href="/admin.php/speakers/edit/speakerid/%20www.asknature.org"&gt;AskNature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, explores what happens if we think of nature by function and looks at what organisms can teach us about design. &lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

He's admired for his new perspectives on technology and its relevance to history, biology and religion.</whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there is no one better to contemplate the meaning of cultural change -- bad? good? too slow? too bold? -- than Kevin Kelly, &lt;strong&gt;whose life story reads like a treatise on the value of technology&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether by renouncing all material things save his bicycle (which he then rode 3,000 miles), founding an organization (the All-Species Foundation) to catalog all life on earth, or by touting new gadgets in &lt;em&gt;WIRED,&lt;/em&gt; Kelly hasn&amp;#39;t stopped exploring the phenomena of technical and biological creation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In articles for the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;New York Times,&lt;/em&gt; among others, he has celebrated scientific breakthroughs, and at &lt;a href="http://longnow.org/" target="_blank"&gt;the Long Now Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, where he serves on the board, &lt;strong&gt;he champions projects that look 10,000 years into the future. &lt;/strong&gt;One such project is the&amp;nbsp;Rosetta Project, which will catalogue more than 1,000 languages on a disks to be placed nearby the 10,000 Year Clock.&amp;nbsp;Kelly&amp;#39;s newest book &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline" class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Technology Wants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;asks what appears to be his life&amp;#39;s core question: &amp;quot;How should I think about new technology when it comes along?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly discusses the &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kelly07/kelly07_index.html" target="_blank"&gt;7th Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; at length in the July 18, 2007, edition of Edge.org.&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

      <description>Writer</description>
      <whotheyare>Detective of fads and emerging subcultures, chronicler of jobs-you-never-knew-existed, Malcolm Gladwell's work is toppling the popular understanding of bias, crime, food, marketing, race, consumers and intelligence.</whotheyare>
      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;Malcolm Gladwell searches for the counterintuitive in what we all take to be the mundane: cookies, sneakers, pasta sauce. A &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; staff writer since 1996, he visits obscure laboratories and infomercial set kitchens as often as the hangouts of freelance cool-hunters -- a sort of pop-R&amp;amp;D gumshoe -- and for that has become a star lecturer and bestselling author.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sparkling with curiosity, undaunted by difficult research (yet an eloquent, accessible writer), &lt;strong&gt;his work uncovers truths hidden in strange data&lt;/strong&gt;. His always-delightful &lt;a href="http://gladwell.typepad.com/gladwellcom/" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; tackles topics from serial killers to steroids in sports, while provocative recent work in the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2007/2007_12_17_c_iq.html" target="_blank"&gt;sheds new light on the Flynn effect&lt;/a&gt; -- the decades-spanning rise in I.Q. scores.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gladwell has written four books. &lt;a href="http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which began as a &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; piece, applies the principles of epidemiology to crime (and sneaker sales), while &lt;a href="http://www.gladwell.com/blink/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; examines the unconscious processes that allow the mind to &amp;quot;thin slice&amp;quot; reality -- and make decisions in the blink of an eye. His third book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Outliers&lt;/em&gt;, questions the inevitabilities of success and identifies the relation of success to nature versus nurture. The newest work,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures&lt;/em&gt;, is an anthology of his &lt;em&gt;New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;contributions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says: &amp;quot;There is more going on beneath the surface than we think, and more going on in little, finite moments of time than we would guess.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

And co-founder Mena Trott, who rose to Internet fame with her own blog, &lt;a href="http://mena.vox.com/" target="_blank"&gt;DollarShort&lt;/a&gt;, has become a strong voice explaining the role of personal blogging in today&amp;#39;s culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trott and her husband Ben developed &lt;a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Movable Type&lt;/a&gt;  for their own use in 2001, but it became immensely popular and they dove in full-time. By the time they were preparing their blog-hosting service &lt;a href="http://www.typepad.com/" target="_blank"&gt;TypePad&lt;/a&gt;, investors were knocking on the door. In 2004, the company grew from seven employees to 50, with Mena Trott serving as chief executive, as well as an interface designer. Today, having acquired &lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt;  and introduced rich-media sharing platform &lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Six Apart&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s software gives online voice to millions of people&lt;/strong&gt; and organizations worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>

      <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;As founder and publisher of &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skeptic Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Michael Shermer has exposed fallacies behind intelligent design, 9/11 conspiracies, the low-carb craze, alien sightings and other popular beliefs and paranoias. But it&amp;#39;s not about debunking for debunking&amp;#39;s sake. &lt;strong&gt;Shermer defends the notion that we can understand our world better only by matching good theory with good science.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus, in order to explore a conspiracy theory that pre-planted explosives caused the World Trade Center towers to fall on 9/11, the magazine called on demolition experts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shermer&amp;#39;s work offers cognitive context for our often misguided beliefs: In the absence of sound science, incomplete information can powerfully combine with the power of suggestion (helping us hear Satanic lyrics when &amp;quot;Stairway to Heaven&amp;quot; plays backwards, for example). In fact, a common thread that runs through beliefs of all sorts, he says, is our tendency to convince ourselves: &lt;strong&gt;We overvalue the shreds of evidence that support our preferred outcome, and ignore the facts we aren&amp;#39;t looking for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>
