    <name>The Creative Spark</name>
    <description>How are we inspired? Where might our imaginations take us? What does creativity look like in its wildest form? These clever, invigorating speakers plumb the wellspring of invention.&#13;
&#13;
Writer, director and producer &lt;a href="/index.php/talks/view/id/205"&gt;J.J. Abrams&lt;/a&gt;' exuberant talk explores the nature of storytelling, the changing face of filmmaking and the possibility that mystery is more important than knowledge. Artist and programmer &lt;a href="/index.php/talks/view/id/172"&gt;John Maeda&lt;/a&gt; shares stories and observations about what complexity has taught him about simplicity, and how their relationship inspires him. Meanwhile, designer &lt;a href="/index.php/talks/view/id/197"&gt;Philippe Starck&lt;/a&gt; explains how his iconic creations come by way of the primordial soup.&#13;
&#13;
&lt;a href="/index.php/talks/view/id/14"&gt;Golan Levin&lt;/a&gt; shows off his "software art": spellbinding audiovisual experiences that incorporate eerie sonic textures and tangles of color that move with life of their own. Pianist &lt;a href="/index.php/talks/view/id/46"&gt;Jennifer Lin&lt;/a&gt;, just 14 when she performed at TED, confects stunning, virtuosic compositions on the fly. And illustrator &lt;a href="/index.php/talks/view/id/182"&gt;Maira Kalman&lt;/a&gt; considers the role of knowledge (or lack thereof) in the creative process -- and concludes that daydreaming is the best job on Earth.&#13;
&#13;
Don't miss game designer &lt;a href="/index.php/talks/view/id/146"&gt;Will Wright&lt;/a&gt;'s preview of Spore, in which players control the evolution of custom-designed critters -- and colonize a galaxy. Or the dancers of &lt;a href="/index.php/talks/view/id/24"&gt;Pilobolus&lt;/a&gt;, who suggest a mutating organism that grows mouths and legs, slithers, drips like oil and turns itself inside out. And be sure to visit actor &lt;a href="/index.php/talks/view/id/60"&gt;Anna Deavere Smith&lt;/a&gt;, who delves into history, crime, race and culture by channeling the voices of four authentic American characters.</description>
