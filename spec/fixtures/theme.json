These clever, invigorating speakers plumb the wellspring of invention.\r\n\r\nWriter, director and producer <a href=\"\/index.php\/talks\/view\/id\/205\">J.J. Abrams<\/a>' exuberant talk explores the nature of storytelling, the changing face of filmmaking and the possibility that mystery is more important than knowledge. Artist and programmer <a href=\"\/index.php\/talks\/view\/id\/172\">John Maeda<\/a> shares stories and observations about what complexity has taught him about simplicity, and how their relationship inspires him. Meanwhile, designer <a href=\"\/index.php\/talks\/view\/id\/197\">Philippe Starck<\/a> explains how his iconic creations come by way of the primordial soup.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"\/index.php\/talks\/view\/id\/14\">Golan Levin<\/a> shows off his \"software art\": spellbinding audiovisual experiences that incorporate eerie sonic textures and tangles of color that move with life of their own.

And illustrator <a href=\"\/index.php\/talks\/view\/id\/182\">Maira Kalman<\/a> considers the role of knowledge (or lack thereof) in the creative process -- and concludes that daydreaming is the best job on Earth.\r\n\r\nDon't miss game designer <a href=\"\/index.php\/talks\/view\/id\/146\">Will Wright<\/a>'s preview of Spore, in which players control the evolution of custom-designed critters -- and colonize a galaxy. Or the dancers of <a href=\"\/index.php\/talks\/view\/id\/24\">Pilobolus<\/a>, who suggest a mutating organism that grows mouths and legs, slithers, drips like oil and turns itself inside out. And be sure to visit actor <a href=\"\/index.php\/talks\/view\/id\/60\">Anna Deavere Smith<\/a>, who delves into history, crime, race and culture by channeling the voices of four authentic American characters.","shortsummary":"Speakers who talk about the creative process","talks_description":"","speakers_description":"","slug":"the_creative_spark","is_featured":false}}
