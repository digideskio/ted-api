    <whotheyare>Once the US Vice President, then star of &lt;em&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/em&gt;, now Nobel Peace Prize winner, Al Gore found a way to focus the world's attention on climate change. In doing so, he has invented a new medium -- the Keynote movie -- and reinvented himself.</whotheyare>
    <whylisten>&lt;p&gt;Unlike some in public office, Al Gore always intended to get something done, and since leaving Washington, DC -- following the tumultuous 2000 election -- he&amp;#39;s still at it. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;his campaign for alerting the world to the dangers of climate change&lt;/strong&gt; has only gained momentum. His Oscar-winning &lt;a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the third most successful documentary ever released at the box office. Gore&amp;#39;s famed PowerPoint presentation has drawn in a reluctant public, with its meticulously researched content and lucid style. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Gore himself has found his footing as a communicator. The once &amp;quot;wooden&amp;quot; style has given way to &lt;strong&gt;a warmth and humor that reveal the depth of his experience&lt;/strong&gt; as a soldier, congressman, senator, veep, TV executive, teacher and author. Arguably, Gore is better positioned today than he has ever been to affect the future of our environment and world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was awarded the &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize for 2007&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &amp;quot;for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for &lt;strong&gt;the measures that are needed to counteract such change&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</whylisten>
